# Milestone 2
## Preprocessing
To clean up the data, we got rid of some features that we decided we were not going to use, such as url, author, token_count.
We also decided to use only english comments so we used the language feature to remove the rows that were not classified as english.
We removed punctuation from our data and also made all the comments lowercase. 
We removed common words like it, the, a, and, to for the purpose of finding patterns with the words in the comments.
## Data Exploration
We made a chart of some frequently used words in comments and the scores they had. So far we were only able to do this on a shortened version of the dataframe.
